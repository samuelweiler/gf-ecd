# Options for gender free English Country Dance calling
Samuel Weiler and Louise Siddons<br>
Version 1.0, November 2018

The growing adoption of "larks" and "ravens" as position terms in contra dance presents
another option for how to call gender free ECD.  Using these new terms for ECD can be
more awkward than using them for contra
because of the diversity of proper, improper, and odd-formation dances in the modern ECD repertoire. 

This note compares several approaches for gender free ECD, describes how ECD was called at 
several events in 2018, and concludes with a recommendation to use "larks" and "ravens" (only) when
they're helpful and only after clarifying, for each dance, the frame of reference in which "left" and
"right" are considered.  

We believe gender free ECD is in a period of rapid change, and this guidance should be taken as
"best *current* practice" only.

This note does not explore the "why" or "why not" for gender free calling, merely the "how".

## Background

There is a long tradtion of gender free ECD using global terminology.  At the LCFD dance in Boston, landmarks (e.g. "the clock side of the hall" or "the window side") are used for the rare occasions when one dancer or one side of a longways set needs to be called out separately from the others.

[Read Weaver's document on Boston's conventions](https://www.lcfd.org/gf-ecd-calling-conventions.html) provides excellent background.  Bruce Hamilton's [Notes on Teaching Country Dance](https://www.cdss.org/index.php/vm-store/books/notes-on-teaching-country-dance-263-detail), while not aimed at gender-free calling, also discusses global directions.

## Frame of Reference

Why is using "larks" and "ravens" terms for ECD trickier than using them for contra and Scottish?  Primarily *frame of reference*.

In squares, circles, and improper dances (including Beckett formation
dances), "larks on the left, ravens on the right" applies as facing into
the minor set.  In a proper longways dance, the frame of reference is
the top of the hall, so there is one long line of larks facing one long
line of ravens.

The modern contra dance repetoire is made up almost exclusively with improper dances.  In these, 
"larks on the left, ravens on the right" makes sense with a
frame of reference of "facing in to the minor set", and that frame of reference is consistent for
nearly all contra dances done in an evening.  It also makes sense for squares where, again, there exists an obvious frame of reference of "face into the center".

By contrast, the modern ECD repetoire has a diverse mix of dance formations.


## Experiences in 2018

We are aware of several dance camps that used "larks" and "ravens" terminology in 2018 for contra, ECD, and/or Scottish country dance: [Oberlin's Dandelion Romp](http://www2.oberlin.edu/stuorg/dromp/), [Queer Contra Dance Camp](https://www.lcfd.org/sf/DanceCamp/), LCFD spring camp, [LCFD fall camp](https://www.lcfd.org/lcfd/fall-dance-camp/), Swing Into Summer at Pinewoods, ESCape at Pinewoods, [Youth Dance Weekend](https://youthdanceweekend.org/), Supersonic, Form the Ocean, #dance weekend, and the [Next Generation camp](http://www.nextgendancecamp.org/).  Many CDSS camps also used "larks" and "ravens" for at least some sessions: Harmony of Song and Dance, American Week, Family Week, Campers Week, and Camp Louise.

We attended six of those camps and called ECD at two.  Here are some observations:


### Global directions and landmarks: Queer Contra Dance Camp, Monte Toyon, April 2018

At Queer Camp, I (Sam) used global directions and landmarks, consistent with past practice at LCFD camps.


### Setting frame of reference: ESCape - English-Scottish-Contra, Pinewoods, July 2018

At ESCape, contra and Scottish were called with "larks" and "ravens".  ECD was called with "men" and "women".

Terry Harvey established a frame of reference for Scottish dances of "as facing the front of the hall, larks on the left, ravens on the right".  This differed from the frame of reference used in most of the contra dances, with the frame of reference being "face into the minor set".  For the occasional proper contra dance, the caller specified the different frame of reference.

Anecdotally, dancers adapted well to the different frames of reference.


### Reframing / rechoreographing dances: Next Generation Dance Camp, Mt. Hood Kiwanis Camp, October 2018

At the Next Generation dance camp, I (Sam) called ECD to a group with limited ECD experience by treating
every longways dance as though it were improper.  I instructed the dancers to "line up for every dance as
though you're doing a contra - larks on the left, ravens on the right".  I then used "larks" and "ravens"
even when I previously would have used more global directions.  For example, when calling a traditionally-proper-formation dance, instead of calling a figure for "first corners", I called it for "ravens".  (e.g., Corelli's Maggot began with "ravens" setting to each other.)

On the whole the session went smoothly.  Anecdotally, most dancers did not notice the experiment.  At least one dancer reported confusion - they had heard the name of familiar dance (e.g. Barbarini's Tambourine) and missed the frame of reference setup.  

### Global instructions without landmarks: YDW, Vermont, October 2018

At YDW, I (Louise) called the ECD track using only global instructions with internal referents: partner, corner, neighbor, etc.  I also called a couple of contras, also with only global instructions (including "right-hand chain," and "left-hand chain").  Contra is primary at YDW, and the dancers who attend are mostly inexperienced English dancers; several people made a point of telling me it was the first time they'd done ECD. They lined up however they chose, and I began each walkthrough by introducing key relationships ("Your partner is across from you. As you face your partner, first corners are on the right diagonal, and second corners on the left diagonal." Etc.). I made no mention of individual roles within each couple, and no one asked. I also did not call dances that required the use of external frames of reference -- a decision that was based on a) the fact that I still had 90% of my repertoire available to me after eliminating those dances, and b) my desire to stay within a contra-familiar framework of internal-reference-only descriptors when working with an ECD-inexperienced group.

As I re-developed my walkthroughs for dances in my repertoire throughout late 2017-early 2018 to use global instructions, I was struck by how thinking and teaching globally improved dancers' comprehension regardless of experience. At YDW, the dancers are already largely adept at dancing in a gender-free context, and so global instructions worked very smoothly.

## Recommendations for leaders:

* Use **global instructions** to avoid naming individual positions whenever possible.  As you prepare a dance, consider whether naming individuals is actually necessary, or if it simply reflects gendered bias.
* When naming individual positions is unavoidable, prepare as sets are formed by **establishing the frame of reference** for each dance, ideally using the traditional orientation.  Then use "larks" and "ravens".
* Circles, squares, and other "all face the center" formations are particularly well suited to using "larks" and "ravens".
* Expect evolution in this advice and terms over time.  

## Recommendations for dance organizers:

* Negotiate the use of gender free terms with callers **when they are hired**.  While some callers new to gender free calling may welcome using gender free terms, others may be unwilling.  Work this out before commitments are made.
* Do not dictate a particular form of gender free calling.  The choice of which terms to use and whether to rechoreograph dances is evolving, and callers should be given space to experiment.
* Announce the intention to use gender free terms to dancers in advance.
